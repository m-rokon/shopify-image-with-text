#  :boom: Image with Text ( Shopify ) :foggy:

## # How this will look like? Check below :point_down:

![image with text](/assets/shopify-image-with-text.png)

## Get it into your project :wink:

Copy the `image-with-text.liquid` sections code and create a liquid file in your `sections` folder or just copy this file and paste into your `sections` folder.

Then, add the css code from `assets/tailwind.css` in your css file which is linked in your `theme.liquid` file. 

** **Remember**, this project built with `TailwindCSS`. If you're not using `TailwindCSS` in your project then you might have to right some css code by your own.

Now, add this section from your theme editor in the store admin pannel. And voila!! you're done. You can change the column order there too. Just click on the `Image With Text` title, you will see an image picker and settings there. From settings, just change the order and this will look like below :point_down:

Happy coding, save your time and enjoy :tada: :tada: :tada:
