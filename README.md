## Get it into your project :wink: 

Copy the `image-with-text.liquid` sections code and create a liquid file in your `sections` folder or just copy this file and paste into your `sections` folder.

Now, add this section from your theme editor in the store admin pannel. And voila!! you're done. You can change the column order there too. Just click on the `Image With Text` title, you will see an image picker and settings there. From settings, just change the order and this will look like below :point_down:
